## Environment Variables

Set these in your `.env` file locally or in Streamlit Cloud secrets:

| Variable | Description | Required? |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key | Yes |
| `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` | Your Unstructured.io API key for PDF parsing | Yes |
| `DEFAULT_LLM_TYPE` | LLM provider - `openai` or `huggingface` | No (default: openai) |
| `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` | Your HuggingFace API key (if using HF models) | Only if `DEFAULT_LLM_TYPE=huggingface` |
| `COHERE_API_KEY` | Your Cohere API key (if using reranking) | No |

## Usage

1. Upload an earnings call transcript PDF (usually available on company investor relations websites)
2. Wait for processing (this might take a minute or two depending on the document size)
3. Ask questions about the call (e.g., "What was the revenue growth in Q3?", "What's the company's outlook for next year?")
4. Get answers with source quotes and speaker attribution
5. Use the "Clear document" button when you want to upload a new transcript

## Data Handling

All data is processed and stored temporarily. When you click "Clear document", all associated data is removed including:
- Document metadata
- Vector embeddings
- Uploaded files
- Temporary processing files

## Technical Details

CallCanvas uses:
- **Streamlit** for the user interface
- **LangChain** for orchestration
- **Unstructured.io** for high-quality PDF extraction
- **ChromaDB** for vector storage
- **OpenAI API** (or HuggingFace) for answer generation
- **BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5** for embedding generation

The app features a hybrid search system combining dense vector embeddings with BM25 for improved retrieval.

## Debugging

If you encounter any issues:
- Check that your API keys are correctly set
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits
- For OpenAI users, check your usage limits
- For Streamlit Cloud, make sure to select a higher memory instance if processing large documents
